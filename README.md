# QuickPitch

Description:

  This is an android app that allows investors to view entrepreneurs' profiles and choose whether
  they want to get in contact with them or not. The entrepreneur profile has a video description 
  along with some information on the entrepreneur.

I developed this app on a team with 5 other programmers. We were all involved in the design process, but then we split into a front end and back end team. I worked mostly on the UI, however I did help with several issues on the backend.
